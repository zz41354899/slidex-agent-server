# SlideX agent service boundary

This directory owns the SlideX-specific orchestration around the Heddle SDK.

- `heddleDriver.ts` constructs a user-scoped Heddle conversation engine.
- `mockConversationEngine.ts` adapts the existing deterministic mock driver to
  the same engine/run-service path. Mock mode changes execution only; it must
  still exercise Heddle run identity, replay, cancellation, product history,
  and the production HTTP/SSE contracts.
- `slidexHeddleAgent.ts` owns SlideX prompts, MotionDoc artifact resolution, and
  the SlideX tool-approval policy.
- `slidexAgentRunService.ts` coordinates durable SlideX sessions around
  `ConversationRunService` from `@roackb2/heddle/hosted`. Heddle remains
  responsible for execution, cancellation, ordered activity events, and replay;
  this service adds product authorization, chat persistence, MotionDoc
  finalization, session hydration/reset, active-run discovery, and the product
  result projection. Active-run lookup and reset cancellation delegate to the
  existing Heddle run service; do not add a second run registry.
- `types.ts` and `runtime.ts` retain the legacy request-bound streaming driver
  while clients migrate to the reconnectable run protocol.

The public run envelope and runtime payload validation come from
`@roackb2/heddle-remote`. HTTP/SSE handles, authentication, and route policy
remain in `server/routes`. MotionDoc editing logic belongs in the MCP extension.
The shared schema projects Heddle's rich internal activities to the small
JSON-safe shape consumed by SlideX (`type`, `text`, `tool`, and `result.ok`);
internal engine state and traces must not cross the product API. Generic run
behavior must be added to Heddle, not reimplemented here.

Accepted user messages and success, cancellation, or failure terminals are
persisted as one explainable product history. Reset marks an in-flight address
before deleting its session so a late result cannot recreate deleted state.
The route layer maps the service's stable product errors to HTTP status codes
and sanitizes unknown failures; provider/runtime details stay in server logs.
