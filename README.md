# SlideX Agent Server

Small Node.js 20+ service for the SlideX conversational agent prototype.

It includes:

- Express server with tRPC for regular APIs.
- Express SSE route at `POST /api/agent/stream`.
- Zod validation for API inputs and persisted sessions.
- Supabase Auth token verification.
- Local JSON session storage for Railway persistent volumes.
- Heddle adapter that creates a per-request engine with the user's own LLM key while reusing one durable Heddle conversation per SlideX session.
- MotionDoc MCP stdio subprocess manager.
- React chat panel served by the same Express app in production.

## Local Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm test
npm run dev
```

Set these values in `.env`:

```bash
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

The API server binds `PORT` (default 3000) and the Vite dev proxy reads the same `PORT`, so if 3000 is taken run `PORT=3010 npm run dev` and both move together. Vite auto-picks a free web port if 5173 is busy and prints the URL. If the API port is taken the server exits with a clear message telling you to set `PORT`.

## Agent Modes

`AGENT_DRIVER=mock` is the default for local development. It exercises tRPC,
local sessions, the reconnectable Heddle run lifecycle, SSE, cancellation, and
MotionDoc updates without calling an LLM. Mock and real modes use the same
`SlideXAgentRunService`; only model/tool execution changes.

The reconnectable run API is also default-off so deploying this branch preserves the upstream server behavior. Set `SLIDEX_AGENT_ENABLED=true` to register `/api/agent/runs`, `/api/agent/runs/:runId/events`, and `/api/agent/runs/:runId/cancel`. The SlideX editor must be built with `NEXT_PUBLIC_SLIDEX_AGENT_ENABLED=true` at the same time. Leave both flags unset or `false` to keep the conversational agent hidden; the existing `/api/agent/stream` route is unaffected.

### Testing without Supabase (dev auth bypass)

If you don't have Supabase set up, enable `DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=1` (dev only — it is ignored when `NODE_ENV=production`). Every request then authenticates as `DEV_USER_ID` (default `dev-user`), so you can drive the tRPC procedures, the web UI, and `/api/agent/stream` with no token. Example — the full agent stream over HTTP:

```bash
DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=1 AGENT_DRIVER=mock npm run dev
# in another shell (use the server port printed by `npm run dev`):
curl -sN -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/agent/stream \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"message":"Create a deck about stateless agents","motionDoc":"","llmApiKey":"dummy-key-123456"}'
```

With `AGENT_DRIVER=heddle` the same call runs the real agent (needs a valid `llmApiKey` in the body and `MOTIONDOC_MCP_*` configured).

The dogfood branch pins an exact unpublished Heddle commit so the integration
can be verified before npm publication. Replace that commit pin with the exact
released npm version before making the coordinated PRs merge-ready. Set
`AGENT_DRIVER=heddle` and point at the SlideX MotionDoc MCP command:

```bash
AGENT_DRIVER=heddle
HEDDLE_WORKSPACE_ROOT=/app
MOTIONDOC_MCP_COMMAND=node
MOTIONDOC_MCP_ARGS='["/app/path/to/motiondoc-mcp.js"]'
MOTIONDOC_MCP_CWD=/app
```

The SlideX conversational agent is built in this repo (`src/server/agent/slidexHeddleAgent.ts`), driven by `src/server/agent/heddleDriver.ts`. The driver prepares the SlideX MCP once as a **self-contained Heddle host extension**, then builds a fresh, user-scoped conversation engine per request and delegates the turn to the agent module. The stable per-user/session `stateRoot` and deterministic internal session ID make those engines reuse one durable Heddle conversation. Heddle owns model-facing history, leases, and compaction; the server's `Session.messages` remains the user-facing chat projection and is not replayed into model prompts.

The extension uses Heddle 4.2 mirror result-artifact rules for MotionDoc-writing tools. Each updated MotionDoc is persisted and set as the current session artifact while its full `source` remains inline for the next stateless MCP edit. The agent reads a newly mirrored artifact after the turn; if no new artifact was produced, it preserves the request's authoritative MotionDoc so a read-only turn cannot restore stale deck state.

Heddle owns the MCP subprocess lifecycle via the extension (spawned per tool call), so `MOTIONDOC_MCP_*` is just the command Heddle runs — the built-in `StdioMcpProcessManager` is not used on the Heddle path.

The server never stores the user's LLM API key. It is accepted only in the stream request body and passed into `createConversationEngine({ apiKey, preferApiKey: true, model })` for that request.

Heddle's `stateRoot` is created per user/session under `DATA_DIR/heddle`, so its local state also lands on the Railway volume.

## Railway

Railway deploys from `railway.json` and `Dockerfile`.

Runtime variables:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
AGENT_DRIVER=heddle
SUPABASE_URL=...
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=...
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
DEFAULT_MODEL=gpt-4.1
HEDDLE_WORKSPACE_ROOT=/app
MOTIONDOC_MCP_COMMAND=...
MOTIONDOC_MCP_ARGS=...
MOTIONDOC_MCP_CWD=...
```

Attach a Railway volume and mount it at `/data`, or set `DATA_DIR` to the mounted path. If Railway injects `RAILWAY_VOLUME_MOUNT_PATH`, the server will use that when `DATA_DIR` is not set.

`GET /healthz` is used as the deployment healthcheck.

## API Shape

tRPC procedures:

- `health`
- `sessions.list`
- `sessions.create`
- `sessions.get`
- `sessions.rename`
- `sessions.delete`

SSE:

```http
POST /api/agent/stream
Authorization: Bearer <supabase-access-token>
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: text/event-stream
```

Body:

```json
{
  "sessionId": "optional-session-id",
  "message": "Create a deck from this outline",
  "motionDoc": "# Current deck",
  "llmApiKey": "user-owned-key",
  "model": "gpt-4.1"
}
```

Events are emitted as normal SSE frames with `event:` and JSON `data:` fields: `session`, `status`, `tool`, `token`, `motionDoc`, `complete`, and `error`.

When `SLIDEX_AGENT_ENABLED=true`, the reconnectable run API used by the SlideX editor is:

- `POST /api/agent/runs` to accept a run and return its `runId`.
- `GET /api/agent/sessions/:sessionId` to restore durable product history and
  discover the active Heddle run for that authenticated conversation.
- `DELETE /api/agent/sessions/:sessionId` to cancel any active run and reset the
  product conversation without changing the editor's current deck.
- `GET /api/agent/runs/:runId/events`, using either `?after=<sequence>` or
  `Last-Event-ID`, to stream and replay canonical Heddle run events.
- `POST /api/agent/runs/:runId/cancel` to request cancellation.

Every SSE frame uses the canonical event `kind` as `event:`, its ordered
`sequence` as `id:`, and the validated Heddle remote envelope as JSON `data:`.
JSON failures use `{ "error": { "code", "message" } }` with stable 401, 400,
404, 409, and sanitized 500 behavior. Product history records cancelled and
failed terminals so a restored conversation never ends with an unexplained
orphan user message.
